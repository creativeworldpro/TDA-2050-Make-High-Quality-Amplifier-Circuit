The TDA2050 is a great sounding chip amplifier with lots of power. 
I’ll walk you through the amplifier design process as I build a 25 Watt stereo amplifier with the TDA2050. Before you begin, you’ll want to get an idea of how much output power you want from the amplifier.

The TDA2050 can be powered from a split supply or single supply. The amplifier’s output power will be higher with a split supply, so that’s what I’ll use here

The TDA 2050 is a monolithic integrated circuit in a Penta watt package, intended for use as an audio class-AB audio amplifier.


Component List

To make this wireless power transfer circuit, we might need some electronics component.

All components list have been given below –

Component List – 

•	TDA – 2050

•	Resistor – 18 k*2, 680 Ω, 2.2 Ω

•	Polyester Film Capacitor – 2A 104J

•	Voltage Gain: 80dB

•	Output: 28Watts with 4Ω speaker

•	Short-circuit protection (OUT to GND)

•	Thermal shutdown


Applications

•	Used for Audio signal Amplification

•	Suitable for high power amplification

•	Capable of operating on dual/split power supply

•	Can be used to cascade audio speakers


Hardware of SMT Project Circuit

To make this mini power amplifier circuit, we might need some electronics component. JLCPCB has its own parts library. JLCPCB has 200k+ in stock components, 24 hours rapid SMT assembly. You can check SMT parts library here - https://jlcpcb.com/parts


Circuit Connection – Step 1

To make this high quality amplifier circuit, 1st we connect 18kΩ resistor with 1no leg of sound IC. Then we make a parallel connection between two resistors. That resistor is 680Ω and 18kΩ. Now connect, it’s parallel point with 2no leg of sound IC and other terminal of 18kΩ resistor with 4no leg of TDA-2050.

The other terminal of 680 ohm resistor is open now. Connect 10µf/50v capacitor with empty terminal of 680 ohm resistor. 
Then connect 1µf/50v capacitor positive leg with 1no leg of TDA-2050 sound IC.

We utilize JLCPCB (https://jlcpcb.com/RTA) to printout our PCB.

Circuit Connection – Step 2

To make it in a easy way, now we connect a 220µf/25v capacitor and a polyester film capacitor with each other. Now connect this capacitor negative leg with 3no leg of sound IC and the capacitor positive leg will be empty now.

As above, we make a connection between polarity film capacitor and a polyester film capacitor, at the same way we make same connection between these two components.
This time, we connect this capacitor positive leg with 5no leg of sound IC. But at the moment, it’s negative leg will be empty, until we connect it with other components


Circuit Connection – Step 3

It is the time to connect 2.2Ω resistor with our powerful amplifier circuit. We connect this resistor with 4no leg of sound IC and then connect 10µf/50v capacitor positive leg with the empty leg of 2.2Ω resistor.

Our circuit connection going to the last position. Now, we jest connect sound speaker, audio input cable and power source with the circuit.


Circuit Connection – Step 4


To input audio, now we need to connect audio input cable, with the circuit. Connect audio input L/R cable with negative leg of 1µf/50v capacitor and connect audio input “G” cable with 18kΩ resistor, that is connected with 1no leg of IC .

For output audio, now we connect a sound speaker with the circuit. Connect sound speaker one terminal with 4 leg of IC and other terminal with 18kΩ resistor, that is connected with 1no leg of sound IC.

To operate this amplifier circuit, now we just connect power source with the amplifier circuit. For power source, we are using DC-12v. We connect DC-12v positive cable with 5no leg of IC and DC-12v negative cable with 3no leg of IC.


Circuit Connection – Step 5


Our circuit is now completely ready for use. Now, we need to connect a heat sink with the sound IC. Then just plug in power, connect audio device with audio input cable and play music.

Soldering And Cleaning

Neat and perfect soldering is an important part of all kind of PCBs. Since soldering, you should remember that, there should not be any kind of short circuit. After soldering all leg, we cut-off the extra leg of all electronics component.
